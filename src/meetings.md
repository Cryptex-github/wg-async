# Meetings

We have weekly meetings with a rotating agenda for each one.
Once a month (aspirationally on the first Thursday of the month) we have a sprint planning meeting.
The other weeks are used for [reading club], deep dives, or whatever else we have a need for.
Additionally, we have a [triage meeting] on every other Monday.

Meetings are held either on Zulip or one of the many videoconferencing systems.
For video meetings, we will announce each of them on the [#wg-async] Zulip stream when they are starting.

All are welcome to attend any meeting!
