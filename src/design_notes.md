# Design notes

This section attempts to capture interesting bits of the "async design space", with a focus on "future-looking" (no pun intended) ideas (though it'd be nice to come in and backfill older, approved designs). For each idea, it tries to capture a combination of

* use cases
* interesting aspects to the design
* alternatives
* interactions with other features

This is very much a WIP, PRs welcome!
