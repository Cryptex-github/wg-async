# üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Cast of characters

## What is this?

We've created four characters that we use to help drive the "status quo" stories. These four individuals help us to give color to the stories, but of course four people can't cover the full range of people using Async Rust. We've also defined a number of [axes] that give a more complete description.

[axes]: #axes

## The characters

* [Alan: the full stack developer](./characters/alan.md)
* [Grace: the full stack developer](./characters/grace.md)
* [Niklaus: the developer building generic Rust libraries and frameworks](./characters/niklaus.md)
* [Barbara: embedded developer doing networking](./characters/barbara.md)

## Axes

The "axes" are how we categorize and think about the space of people that are using Async Rust. The characters above all represent important points in this "user space", but sometimes it's useful to have a more complete picture.

This list will probably never be complete! If you don't see yourself in the answers listed here, please feel free to suggest additions. ([Instructions here.](./how_to_vision_doc.md#adding-or-adjusting-the-axes-or-set-of-characters))
