## ðŸ¤” Frequently Asked Questions

### **What makes this project different from others?**
SLOW is a library, not an application.

### **Does this project require a custom tailored runtime?**
Ideally, SLOW would be developed in an independent way that permits it to be used across many runtimes in a variety of different environments.

### **How much of this project is likely to be built with open source components from crates.io?**
SLOW builds on other generic libraries available from crates.io. For example, it would like to make use of compression algorithms that others have written, or to use future adapters.

### **What is of most concern to this project?**
Uh, I don't really know! If you develop software like this, maybe open a PR and tell me! --nikomatsakis

### **What is of least concern to this project?**
Uh, I don't really know! If you develop software like this, maybe open a PR and tell me! --nikomatsakis

### **Why is this called SLOW?**
It's like [QUIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC), but slow! Get it? Get it? :D
