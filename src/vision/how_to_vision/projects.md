## How to open a PR

If you'd like to add a new project, please [open a PR using this template][template] and adding a new file into [the `projects` directory][pjd]. Don't forget to add your file to [`SUMMARY.md`] as well.

We are pretty happy to add new projects, although we would prefer only to add a new project if it has some characteristic that is distinct from the other projects we've got so far and which is important to a 'status quo' or 'shiny future' story.
