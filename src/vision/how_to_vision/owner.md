# Goal and initiative owners

This page describes the roles and responsibilities associated with being the **owner** of an item on the [roadmap](../roadmap.md). Roadmap items fall into two categories, top-level goals and initiatives. In both cases, being an owner means that you are responsible for ensuring that the item gets done, but the details of owning a top-level goal are different from owning an initiative.

## Sprint meetings

We are organizing the working group in **two week sprints**. This means that every two weeks we have a sprint planning meeting. **All goal owners are expected to attend!** Initiative owners or other contributors are welcome as well.

The purpose of the sprint planning meeting is to check-in on the progress towards the milestones for each initiative and to see if they need to be adjusted. It's also a chance to raise interesting questions or get advice about tricky things or unexpected problems, as well as to celebrate our progress.

## Owning a top-level goal

As the owner of a **top-level goal** your role is to figure out overall plan for how that goal will be achieved and to track progress. This means breaking up the goal into different initiatives, finding owners for those initiatives (which can be you!), and helping those owners to plan milestones. You are also generally responsible for staying on top of the state of things and updating other owners as to new or interesting developments.

## Owning an initiative

Our definition of [initiative] is precisely the same as that used by the Rust lang team: it corresponds to a some active effort with a clear goal or deliverable(s). As the owner of an **initiative**, your role is to actually get the work done (quite possibly in collaboration with others). You also generally own the design of several components. You can read more about the roles of [initiative owners] on the lang team web page.

### Planning initiative milestones

When you own an initiative, you should work with the owner of the top-level goal and others to plan out a series of **milestones** around the initiative, along with a set of [stakeholders]. These milestones correspond to the various steps you need to take to complete the initiative. Milestones are not fixed and they frequently change as you progress. They usually start out quite vague, such as "author an RFC", and then get more precise as you learn more about what is required: "figure out the design for X", "implement feature Y". We update the status and set of milestones for each sprint status meeting.
