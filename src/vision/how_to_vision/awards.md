# ‚ùì How to vision: Awards

At the end of the [brainstorming period][htvbp], we'll also vote on various awards to give to the status quo and shiny future PRs that were submitted. 

## Award categories

These are the award categories:

* Most humorous story
* Most creative story
* Most supportive -- who left the most helpful comments?
* Most prolific -- who wrote the most stories?
* Most unexpected -- which status quo story (or shiny future) took you by surprise?
* Most painful "status quo" story
* Most ambitious "shiny future" story
* Most extensive FAQ

However, if you have an idea for another award category, we are happy to take suggestions. One rule: the awards can't be negative (e.g., no "most unrealistic"), and they can't be about which thing is "best". That would work against the brainstorming spirit.
