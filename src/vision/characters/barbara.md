### Barbara: embedded developer doing networking

Barbara is building a sensor grid system using Rust. The sensors communicate wirelessly to relay their results, and Barbara is responsible for the networking component. These sensors are relatively simple devices with limited resources, so she is coding in a `#[no_std]` environment and is very careful about things like allocation.
