### Alan: the full stack developer

Alan is a "full stack" developer who has been solving problems for customers in many companies. He's used node.js, Ruby-on-Rails, Django, and a couple other frameworks besides. Alan was recently hired at `fido.io`, a pioneering dog-food delivery business that uses a combination of deep learning and [IoT] to select the optimum dog food for your pet's health. Fido has chosen to build their networking stack in Rust. They were already using Rust for their deep learning code and they wanted to keep to a single language. For the time being, their needs are relatively simple. They want to stand up a server that serves up pages and connects to various back-end and cloud services.
