## Alan: the experienced "GC'd language" developer, new to Rust

### Variant A: Dynamic languages

Alan has been programming for years. He has built systems in Ruby on Rails, node.js, and used Django too. Lately he's been learning Rust and he is tinkering with integrating Rust into some of his projects to get better performance and reliability. He's also building some projects entirely in Rust.

### Variant B: Java

Alan works at a Java shop. They run a number of network services built in Java, along with some that use Kotlin or Scala. He's very familiar with the Java ecosystem and the tooling that the JVM offers. He's also sometimes had to tweak his code to work around garbage collector latencies or to reduce overall memory usage. He's curious to try porting some systems to Rust to see how it works.

## ü§î Frequently Asked Questions

* What does Alan want most from Async Rust?
    * The promise of better performance and memory usage than the languages he's been using. Rust's safety guarantees are important too; he's considered using C++ in the but always judged the maintenance burden would be too high.
* What expectations does Alan bring from his current environment?
    * A focus on ease of use, a strong ecosystem, and great tooling.
