# âœ¨ Barbara Wants Async Read Write

## ðŸš§ Warning: Draft status ðŸš§

This is a draft "shiny future" story submitted as part of the brainstorming period. It is derived from what actual Rust users wish async Rust should be, and is meant to deal with some of the challenges that Async Rust programmers face today.

If you would like to expand on this story, or adjust the answers to the FAQ, feel free to open a PR making edits (but keep in mind that, as peoples needs and desires for async Rust may differ greatly, shiny future stories [cannot be wrong]. At worst they are only useful for a small set of people or their problems might be better solved with alternative solutions). Alternatively, you may wish to [add your own shiny vision story][htvsq]!

## The story

Character: Barbara.

Barbara is creating a `sans-io` network protocol library.  To make her library as useable as possible, she wants her design to be runtime agnostic: so, she decides that her library will run on generic `AsyncRead`/`AsyncWrite` types. Everything goes as planned and before long she's shipped the first version of her library.

As she monitors the performance of her library she becomes less and less satisified. She firmly believes that the library is under-performing and she can make it signficantly better. Being a tried and tested Linux developer, Barbara goes right to `strace` to gain information about how her library interacts with the OS. And immediately her suspicions are confirmed: there are a *lot* of read/write syscalls being made.

She discusses what she found with her friend Grace and decides that the next step is to use buffered IO in order to reduce the total number of syscalls being made.  And she is confident that this will greatly improve the performance of her library.

Unfortunately, Barbara finds that there is no generic buffered equivalents to the `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite` her first version was based on. For a buffered `AsyncRead`, she finds an inconsistent ecosystem: there's a `AsyncBufRead` defined in the `futures` crate but only some runtimes implement it, and `tokio` has a completely different `AsyncBufRead` trait. Barbara decides to use the `AsyncBufRead` from `futures` and provide compatibility mechanisms for users of `tokio` which will allow them to the completely different buffered read primitive in `tokio` to her library.

But, it's even worse for a buffered `AsyncWrite`: with buffered read done, Barbara moves to buffered write and finds out, to her chagrin, that there is no single buffered async writer.  Every runtime provides there own, inconsistent, types. And there are no traits for abstraction. Barbara is exhausted; with no provided abstractions for this primitive Barbara will have to write her own abstractions that can unify across all the runtimes. There are so many hurdles to overcome in order to do this, such as the orphan rule, that Barbara feels there is no reasonable path forward.

## ðŸ¤” Frequently Asked Questions

*NB: These are generic FAQs. Feel free to customize them to your story or to add more.*

### What status quo stories are you retelling?

*Link to status quo stories if they exist. If not, that's ok, we'll help find them.*

### What are the key attributes of this shiny future?

- Just like AsyncRead/AsyncWrite there are no standard traits for buffered I/O

    - This is made worse by the fact that there isnâ€™t even ecosystem traits for buffered writes.

- There are no standard (or even present in futures-io) concrete types for async buffered I/O.

    - Each major runtime has their own async BufReader, BufWriter types.

- All the issues with creating runtime agnostic libraries are very present here. (TODO: link with runtime agnostic lib story)
std::io doesnâ€™t have a BufWrite trait for sync I/O.

    - Itâ€™s less of an issue than in async Rust because of the existence of the standardized std::io::BufWriter.



### What is the "most shiny" about this future? 

*Thing about Rust's core "value propositions": performance, safety and correctness, productivity. Which benefit the most relative to today?*
This benefits productivity and correctness the most. The problem is not performance, in particular, as each runtime provides buffered IO solutions.  The problem is that they are inconsistent and not compatible. This means that writing code that is compatible with any async runtime becomes both: much more difficult and much more likely to be wrong when runtimes change.

### What are some of the potential pitfalls about this future?

*Thing about Rust's core "value propositions": performance, safety and correctness, productivity. Are any of them negatively impacted? Are there specific application areas that are impacted negatively? You might find the sample [projects] helpful in this regard, or perhaps looking at the goals of each [character].*
- Having a design which makes it difficult for existing runtimes to make their buffered IO types compatible or to migrate their runtimes over to the new designs.

### Did anything surprise you when writing this story? Did the story go any place unexpected?

*The act of writing shiny future stories can uncover things we didn't expect to find. Did you have any new and exciting ideas as you were writing? Realize some complications that you didn't foresee?*
The most surprising thing is that there is a buffered read type in `futures` but no buffered *write* type in `futures`.  I would expect both or neither.

### What are some variations of this story that you considered, or that you think might be fun to write? Have any variations of this story already been written?

*Often when writing stories, we think about various possibilities. Sketch out some of the turning points here -- maybe someone will want to turn them into a full story! Alternatively, if this is a variation on an existing story, link back to it here.*
No variations.

### What are some of the things we'll have to figure out to realize this future? What projects besides Rust itself are involved, if any? (Optional)

*Often the 'shiny future' stories involve technical problems that we don't really know how to solve yet. If you see such problems, list them here!*
