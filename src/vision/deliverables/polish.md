## Impact

* Lints guide the user away from common errors and help them both to get started with async Rust and to maintain async Rust programs over time.
* Errors not only show that there is a problem, they help the user to fix it and to learn more about Rust (possibly directing the user to other documentation).
* The generated code from the compiler is high quality and performant.
* Integration with low-level tooling and the like is high-quality.
