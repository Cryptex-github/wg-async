# ðŸ˜± Status quo stories

## ðŸš§ Under construction! Help needed! ðŸš§

We are still in the process of drafting the vision document. The stories you see on this page are examples meant to give a feeling for how a status quo story looks; you can expect them to change. We encourage you to propose your own by opening a PR -- see the ["How to vision"][htv] page for instructions and details.

## What is this

The "status quo" stories document the experience of using Async Rust today. Each story narrates the challenges encountered by [one of our characters][cc] as they try (and typically fail in dramatic fashion) to achieve their goals.

[cc]: ./characters.md

Writing the "status quo" stories helps us to compensate for the [curse of knowledge][cok]: the folks working on Async Rust tend to be experts in Async Rust. We've gotten used to the workarounds required to be productive, and we know the little tips and tricks that can get you out of a jam. The stories help us gauge the cumulative impact all the paper cuts can have on someone still learning their way around. This gives us the data we need to prioritize.

### Based on a true story

These stories may not be true, but they are not fiction. They are based on real-life experiences of actual people. Each story contains a "Frequently Asked Questions" section referencing sources used to create the story. In some cases, it may link to notes or summaries in the [conversations] section, though that is not required. The "Frequently Asked Questions" section also contains a summary of what the "morals" of the story are (i.e., what are the key takeaways), along with answers to questions that people have raised along the way.

[conversations]: ../conversations.md

### The stories provide data we use to prioritize, not a prioritization itself

**Just because a user story is represented here doesn't mean we're going to be able to fix it right now.** Some of these user stories will indicate more severe problems than others. As we consider the stories, we'll select some subset to try and address; that choice is reflected in the [roadmap].
