## Impact

* Users can predict and understand why the compiler raises error messages. Errors are aligned with an experienced user's intuition about how Rust works.
* Error messages identify common misconceptions, suggest solutions, and are generally on par with sync Rust.
  * Errors not only show that there is a problem, they help the user to fix it and to learn more about Rust (possibly directing the user to other documentation).
  * The compiler may suggest crates from the ecosystem to help solve problems when appropriate.
* Lints guide the user away from common errors and help them both to get started with async Rust and to maintain async Rust programs over time.
* Rust's async implementation is high quality and reflects an attention to detail.
  * No internal compiler errors
  * Compiler analysis and code generation passes are precise and not unnecessarily conservative.
  * Integration with low-level tooling and the like is high-quality.
  * The generated code from the compiler is high quality and performant.
