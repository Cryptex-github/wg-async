# Sync and async behave the same

## Impact

**Async code should not be surprising.** In general, if you surround a block of
synchronous code with `async` or mark a sync `fn` as `async`, nothing
unexpected should happen.

- The code should evaluate to the same value after awaiting.
- Any compilation errors should be essentially the same, modulo details around implicit futures in the return type.
