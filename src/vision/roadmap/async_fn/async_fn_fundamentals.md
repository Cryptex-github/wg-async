# Async fn fundamentals

## Impact

* Able to write `async fn` in traits and trait impls
    * Able to easily declare that `T: Trait + Send` where "every async fn in `Trait` returns a `Send` future"
    * Traits that use `async fn` can still be [dyn safe](./async_fn_fundamentals/dyn_async_trait.md) though some tuning may be required
    * Async functions in traits desugar to [impl Trait in traits]
* Able to write ["async fn drop"][async drop] to declare that the destructor may await
* Support for [async closures]
