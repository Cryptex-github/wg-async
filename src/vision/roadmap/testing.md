# Testing

## Impact

* Async applications need the ability to write tests that let them simulate and mock the outside world
* Ability to test edge cases:
    * Long latencies
    * Dropped connections
    * Funky schedules

## Design notes

At the moment, this is an "experimentation" area, but it represents a common need without well-established, widely used solutions.
