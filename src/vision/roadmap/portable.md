# Portable across runtimes, easy to switch

## Impact

* Able to grab libraries from crates.io and mix-and-match them with confidence, no matter what runtime or other libraries you are using
* Able to easily author libraries that can be combined with other libraries and are independent of runtime
* Able to easily change applications between runtimes to explore new possibilities
* Able to easily author new runtimes that try out a new execution strategy or for some new environment and have them interoperate with most extant libraries, without the need to change those libraries
* Able to find runtimes that fit a wide variety of scenarios and use patterns
