# Deliverable owner

Captures the following information:

* If this work is being done in the Rust org, what Rust team(s) own the final decision?
    * If the work is being done externally, where is it being done?
* Who is the [owner] assigned to pursue this?
    * The owner assembles the "menu" of overall solutions to the problem and helps to narrow them down to the most viable.
        * Naturally, they are encouraged to make recommendations on what they consider to be the right choice. These recommendations should include an explanation of what analysis they did on the other options that led them to this recommendation.
