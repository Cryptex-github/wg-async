# wg-async-foundations
Working group dedicated to improving the foundations of Async I/O in Rust

## Getting involved

Our meetings take place at [6:00 PM UTC](https://everytimezone.com/s/3b45ddfe) every Tuesday in our [Zulip stream][zulip]. Feel free to stop by then (or any time!) to introduce yourself.

Also, take a look at our [ongoing work][ongoing] to get a sense of what we're up to, and to look for unclaimed issues you could tackle.
